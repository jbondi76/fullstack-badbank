 * Converts a v10 Table component to a v11 Table component.
 *
 * Given the two versions' significant differences in API, the adapter makes several assumptions about the v10 Table's usage:
 * - It is assumed that the v10 Table component will be the first child.
 * - The v11 columns are read from the v10 columns' labels. If the key of the cells' data does not correspond to the v10 column's label,
 * the user is expected to pass in the labels through the `headerLabels` prop.
 * - Currently only supports up to one layer of nested rows
